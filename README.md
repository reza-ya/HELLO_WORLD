// hello i am reza and i want to do something meaningfull with my life and i so skeptical about every idea i have in my mind,
i think some of the reason of this beacause _do nothing_ always easier , and i tell lie to my soul and for that reason, i become sick, 
very sick.
what have i done to my self ?
why ?
but it is so strange that i have some deep voice in my soul which tell me: your are wrong. you can do better than that.
beacause of that i have inner war in myself to overcome it.
